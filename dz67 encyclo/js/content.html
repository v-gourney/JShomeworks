<h1>Plants list</h1>
<p class="description">Let's take it back to science class: During photosynthesis (you remember that word, don't ya?), plants convert the carbon dioxide we exhale into fresh oxygen and remove toxins from the air we breathe. NASA tested this theory in a landmark 1989 study when they examined how popular houseplants diffuse toxic chemicals including:

  Formaldehyde, which can cause irritation to nose, mouth, and throat.
  Benzane, which can cause irritation to eyes, drowsiness, dizziness, increase in heart rate, headaches, and confusion.
  Trichlorothylene, which can cause dizziness, headache, nausea, and vomiting.
  In the study, they found several, no-fuss plants that actually filter out the bad stuff and easily grow indoors.</p>
